**seededlda** is an R package that implements the seeded-LDA for semi-supervised topic modeling using **quanteda**. The seeded-LDA model was proposed by [Lu et al. (2010)](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2119585). Until version 0.3, that packages has been a simple wrapper around the **topicmodels** package, but the LDA estimator is newly implemented in C++ using the [GibbsLDA++](http://gibbslda.sourceforge.net/) library to be submitted to CRAN in August 2020. The author believes this package implements the seeded-LDA model more closely to the original proposal.

Please see [*Theory-Driven Analysis of Large Corpora: Semisupervised Topic Classification of the UN Speeches*](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0894439320907027) for the overview of semi-supervised topic classification techniques and their advantages in social science research.

[**keyATM**](https://github.com/keyATM/keyATM) is the latest addition to the semi-supervised topic models. The users of seeded-LDA are also encouraged to use that package.
