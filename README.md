# Semisupervised LDA for theory-driven text analysis

**NOTICE:** This R package is renamed from **quanteda.seededlda** to
**seededlda** for CRAN submission.

**seededlda** is an R package that implements the seeded-LDA for
semisupervised topic modeling using **quanteda**. The seeded-LDA model
was proposed by [Lu et
al.Â (2010)](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2119585). Until version
0.3, that packages has been a simple wrapper around the **topicmodels**
package, but the LDA estimator is newly implemented in C++ using the
[GibbsLDA++](http://gibbslda.sourceforge.net/) library to be submitted
to CRAN in August 202. The author believes this package implements the
seeded-LDA model more closely to the original proposal.

Please see [*Theory-Driven Analysis of Large Corpora: Semisupervised
Topic Classification of the UN
Speeches*](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0894439320907027)
for the overview of semisupervised topic classification techniques and
their advantages in social science research.

[**keyATM**](https://github.com/keyATM/keyATM) is the latest addition to
the semisupervised topic models. The users of seeded-LDA are also
encouraged to use that package.

## Install

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("koheiw/seededlda") 
```

## Example

The corpus and seed words in this example are from [*Conspiracist
propaganda: How Russia promotes anti-establishment sentiment
online?*](https://koheiw.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Sputnik-05-ECPR.pdf).

``` r
require(quanteda)
require(seededlda) # changed from quanteda.seededlda to seededlda
```

Users of seeded-LDA has to construct a small dictionary of keywords
(seed words) to define the desired topics.

``` r
dict <- dictionary(file = "tests/data/topics.yml")
print(dict)
## Dictionary object with 6 key entries.
## - [economy]:
##   - market*, money, bank*, stock*, bond*, industry, company, shop*
## - [politics]:
##   - parliament*, congress*, party leader*, party member*, voter*, lawmaker*, politician*
## - [society]:
##   - police, prison*, school*, hospital*
## - [diplomacy]:
##   - ambassador*, diplomat*, embassy, treaty
## - [military]:
##   - military, soldier*, air force, marine, navy, army
## - [nature]:
##   - water, wind, sand, forest, mountain, desert, animal, human
```

``` r
corp <- readRDS("tests/data/data_corpus_sputnik.RDS")
toks <- tokens(corp, remove_punct = TRUE) %>% 
    tokens_compound(dict) # for "air force"
dfmt <- dfm(toks) %>% 
    dfm_select("^[A-Za-z]+$", valuetype = "regex") %>% 
    dfm_remove(stopwords('en')) %>% 
    dfm_trim(min_termfreq = 0.90, termfreq_type = "quantile", 
             max_docfreq = 0.2, docfreq_type = "prop")
```

Many of the top terms of the seeded-LDA are seed words but other topic
words are also identified.

``` r
set.seed(1234)
slda <- textmodel_seededlda(dfmt, dict, residual = TRUE)
print(terms(slda, 20))
