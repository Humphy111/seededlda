# Semisupervided LDA for theory-driven text analysis

**NOTICE** This R package is renamed from **quanteda.seededlda** to
**seededlda** for CRAN submission.

A package implements seeded-LDA for semisupervised topic modeling using
**quanteda** and GibbsLDA++. This seeded-LDA model was proposed by [Lu
et al.Â (2010)](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2119585). Before this
package was submitted to CRAN on August 2020 (until version 0.3), it was
wrapper around the **topicmodels** package, but the LDA estimator is
newly implemented in C++ using the
[GibbsLDA++](http://gibbslda.sourceforge.net/) library by the author.
The author believes this package implements the seeded-LDA model more
closely to the original proposal.

Please see [*Theory-Driven Analysis of Large Corpora: Semisupervised
Topic Classification of the UN
Speeches*](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0894439320907027)
for the overview of semisupervised topic classification techniques and
their advantages in social science research.

[**keyATM**](https://github.com/keyATM/keyATM) is the latest addition to
the semisupervised topic models. The users of seeded-LDA are also
encouraged to use that package.

## Install

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("koheiw/seededlda") 
```

## Example

The corpus and seed words in this example are from [*Conspiracist
propaganda: How Russia promotes anti-establishment sentiment
online?*](https://koheiw.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Sputnik-05-ECPR.pdf).

``` r
require(quanteda)
require(seededlda) # changed from quanteda.seededlda to seededlda
```

``` r
corp <- readRDS("tests/data/data_corpus_sputnik.RDS")
toks <- tokens(corp, remove_punct = TRUE)
dfmt <- dfm(toks) %>% 
    dfm_select("^[A-Za-z]+$", valuetype = "regex") %>% 
    dfm_remove(stopwords('en')) %>% 
    dfm_trim(min_termfreq = 0.90, termfreq_type = "quantile", 
             max_docfreq = 0.1, docfreq_type = "prop")
```

Users of seeded-LDA has to construct a small dictionary of keywords
(seed words) to define the desired topics.

``` r
dict <- dictionary(file = "tests/data/topics.yml")
print(dict)
## Dictionary object with 6 key entries.
## - [economy]:
##   - market*, money, bank*, stock*, bond*, industry, company, shop*
## - [politics]:
##   - parliament*, congress*, party leader*, party member*, voter*, lawmaker*, politician*
## - [society]:
##   - police, prison*, school*, hospital*
## - [diplomacy]:
##   - ambassador*, diplomat*, embassy, treaty
## - [military]:
##   - military, soldier*, air force, marine, navy, army
## - [nature]:
##   - water, wind, sand, forest, mountain, desert, animal, human
```

``` r
set.seed(1234)
slda <- textmodel_seededlda(dfmt, dict, residual = FALSE)
print(terms(slda, 20))
##       economy     politics        society         diplomacy    military

```

Many of the top terms of seeded-LDA models are seed words but other
topic words are also identified.

``` r
topic <- table(topics(slda))
print(topic)
## 
## diplomacy   economy  military    nature  politics   society 
##       163       127       140       174       169       227
```
